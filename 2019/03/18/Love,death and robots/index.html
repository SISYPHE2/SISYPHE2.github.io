<p>differents stories.After reviewing nine episodes,i must say that the episode is not as great as how people told us to be.However,there are more and more people</p>
<p>choose to fllow the trend,share review in their social media and rate highly in Douban. </p>
<p>The situtation is quiet like when another Netflix’s movie ‘roma’ got a hit in chinese audiences.As far as i seen,both plays is a good project,but they didn’t</p>
<p>suppose to get so much attention by the normal auidences.First of all,the background of the story is so far from us.Secondly,the cultural differences are such</p>
<p>a great barrier between us and the dirctor.Last but not least,we can’t deny that as a commerial stream media,the Netflix,always tend to make products which </p>
<p>were directed to its consumers.While,as we all konwn,the chinese audiences,for some reason,can’t be its consumers.</p>
<p>In a nutshell,it’s quiet odd for me that the Netflix’s plays get so much attention in chinese market.As a commerial organization,what the Netflix doing is </p>
<p>trying to make the ‘global topic’ in their consumers despite of the geographical and cultural differences.As chinese audiences,the great leap in both economy</p>
<p>and culture make them have a stronge desire to get into this ‘global topic’,which make the ‘Love,death and robots’ and ‘roma’ so popular in china.</p>
